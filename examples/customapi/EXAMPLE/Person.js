/**
 * @class EXAMPLE.Person
 * This is an example of a custom API. Developers can build their own API's
 * using the NGN and NGNX libraries as a base. 
 * 
 * An example of using this code in a node process would be:
 * 
 * 		require('ngn');
 * 
 * 		var person = new EXAMPLE.Person();
 * 
 * _Outputs:_
 * 		I am person 2.0
 * 
 * Make sure you view the source (hover over EXAMPLE.Person at the top of the page) to see how this extension is created. You may be
 * surprised by how little code there is. Most of it is documentation.
 * @extends NGN.model.Person
