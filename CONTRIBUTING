# Contributing to NGN

If you are interested in contributing to NGN, please
get in touch with me first to propose what you're interested
in creating. I'd be hard pressed to turn down help when it's 
offered, but I want to make sure that there aren't redundant
efforts. So much is happening very quickly and I want to 
avoid people stepping on each other's toes.

If you want to contribute but don't know what to work on,
please visit our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/board/ngn/503b8fa4500fc2f734af867d) to
see our backlog and planned features that aren't yet assigned.

# Coding Guidlines

Please attempt to follow the patterns found in the existing
code base. Ask questions if you have them. 

All contributions will go through a code review process upon completion.
